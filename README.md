Workshop description
=====================

High-throughput sequencing technologies have allowed researchers to extract DNA at the individual, population, and species levels. 
In this workshop students will learn how to analyze and interpret population level genetic information with PLINK and R.
Students will also be exposed to the literature in the different topics, followed by hands on exercises and paper discussion.


Learning goals
=====================
At the end of the workshop the students will be able to:

* Describe what a variant calling file (VCF) format is and how to manage those files.
* Conduct quality assesment of a VCF.
* Learn about population structure and how to compute it with PLINK.
* Learn about linkage disequilibrium and how to compute it with PLINK.
* Learn about basic association testing and genome wide association studies (GWAS).
* Learn about copy number variants (CNVs) and how to test for common CNVs across indidviduals.
* Discuss original literature within the subjects.
